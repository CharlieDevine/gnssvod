    "- It will read RINEX observation files as pandas data frames\n",
    "- It can aggregate the raw data to a lower temporal rate if specified.\n",
    "- It will automatically download orbit and clock files for the corresponding days from the GSSC ESA server\n",
    "- From the orbit and clock files, it will calculate azimuth and elevation for each measurement\n",

    "The function exclusively reads RINEX observation files. Such files typically end with the extension '.yyO' where yy is the last two digit of the year. The function can be used to process a single file, a group of files, or several groups of files corresponding to several receivers, as shown in the examples below. All of this is done by specifying a pattern as the first argument to the function.\n",
